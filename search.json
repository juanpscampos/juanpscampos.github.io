    "text": "Public Debt Dynamics\n\nClosed Economy\nConsider an economy that does not trade with the rest of the world. Let \\(Y_t\\) denote nominal GDP in year \\(t\\), and \\(P_t\\) the GDP deflator. Nominal GDP is given by the product \\(P_t Y_t\\). Let \\(\\pi_t\\) denote the rate of inflation between \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\), defined as:\n\\[\n\\pi_t = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1.\n\\]\nSimilarly, the real GDP growth rate is defined as:\n\\[\ng_t = \\frac{Y_t}{Y_{t-1}} - 1.\n\\]\nLet \\(M_t\\) denote the stock of money at time \\(t\\), and for simplicity assume that all interest-bearing public debt has a one-period maturity. Let \\(D_{t-1}\\) denote the stock of public bonds outstanding at the end of period \\(t-1\\). The average nominal interest rate on public debt issued in \\(t-1\\) is \\(i_t\\). Let \\(AF_t\\) represent government financial assets at time \\(t\\).\nGovernment expenditure in year \\(t\\) consists of two components: non-interest expenditure, denoted \\(G_t\\), and interest payments on outstanding debt, \\(i_t D_{t-1}\\).\nThe government budget constraint in period \\(t\\) is given by:\n\\[\nG_t + i_t D_{t-1} = R_t + (D_t - D_{t-1}) + (M_t - M_{t-1}) + (AF_t - AF_{t-1}).\n\\]\nGovernment budget identity implies that government expenditures are financed through net tax and non-tax revenues from the private sector, \\(R_t\\), money creation \\((M_t - M_{t-1}) \\equiv \\Delta M_t\\), issuance of interest-bearing debt \\((D_t - D_{t-1})\\), and changes in financial assets \\((AF_t - AF_{t-1}) \\equiv \\Delta AF_t\\).\nThe fiscal balance of the government is defined as the difference between revenues and total expenditures, \\(R_t - (G_t + i_t D_{t-1})\\). The primary balance, \\(PB_t\\), is defined as revenues minus expenditures excluding interest payments:\n\\[\nPB_t = R_t - G_t.\n\\]\nRearranging equation government budget and solving for \\(D_t\\) yields:\n\\[\nD_t = (1 + i_t)D_{t-1} - (PB_t - \\Delta M_t - \\Delta AF_t).\n\\]\nDividing both sides of equation (2) by nominal GDP \\(P_t Y_t\\) yields:\n\\[\n\\frac{D_t}{P_t Y_t}\n= \\frac{(1+i_t)D_{t-1}}{P_t Y_t}\n- \\frac{PB_t}{P_t Y_t}\n- \\frac{\\Delta M_t}{P_t Y_t}\n- \\frac{\\Delta AF_t}{P_t Y_t}.\n\\]\nUsing the identities \\(P_t Y_t = (1+g_t)(1+\\pi_t)P_{t-1}Y_{t-1}\\) and defining debt, the primary balance, and seigniorage as shares of GDP:\n\\[\nd_t \\equiv \\frac{D_t}{P_t Y_t}, \\quad\npb_t \\equiv \\frac{PB_t}{P_t Y_t}, \\quad\n\\mu_t \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta M_t}{P_t Y_t},\n\\]\nthe previous equation can be written as:\n\\[\nd_t = \\frac{(1+i_t)}{(1+g_t)(1+\\pi_t)} d_{t-1}\n- (pb_t + \\mu_t + af_t).\n\\]\nUsing the Fisher equation linking nominal and real interest rates:\n\\[\n1 + r_t = \\frac{1+i_t}{1+\\pi_t},\n\\]\ndefine:\n\\[\n\\phi_t \\equiv \\frac{1+r_t}{1+g_t}.\n\\]\nWith this parameter, the government budget constraint can be rewritten as:\n\\[\nd_t = \\phi_t d_{t-1} - (pb_t + \\mu_t + af_t).\n\\]\nDebt dynamics can also be analyzed by computing the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio, \\(\\Delta d_t = d_t - d_{t-1}\\). Subtracting \\(d_{t-1}\\) from both sides yields:\n\\[\n\\Delta d_t = (\\phi_t - 1)d_{t-1} - (pb_t + \\mu_t + af_t).\n\\]\nThe size of the primary balance as a share of GDP, \\(pb_t\\), is a useful indicator of the fiscal effort required to reach a desired debt level. To obtain the debt-stabilizing primary balance, set \\(\\Delta d_t = 0\\). For simplicity, assume that seigniorage and changes in financial assets are zero. The debt-stabilizing primary balance is therefore:\n\\[\npb_t = (\\phi_t - 1)d_{t-1}.\n\\]\nThe debt-stabilizing primary balance depends on several factors:\n\nA higher initial level of debt requires a larger primary surplus to stabilize debt.\nA larger difference between the real interest rate and the real GDP growth rate increases the required primary balance.\nThe availability of seigniorage or other financing sources, such as privatizations, reduces the primary balance required to stabilize debt.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Economy\nThe analysis of debt sustainability in an open economy is similar to that of a closed economy. However, in this case, the government can issue both domestic- and foreign-currency debt.\nTotal public debt at time \\(t\\) is given by:\n\\[\nD_t = D_t^d + e_t D_t^f,\n\\]\nwhere \\(D_t^d\\) denotes domestic-currency debt, \\(D_t^f\\) foreign-currency debt, and \\(e_t\\) is the nominal exchange rate (domestic currency per unit of foreign currency).\nLet \\(i_t^d\\) denote the nominal interest rate on domestic debt and \\(i_t^f\\) the nominal interest rate on foreign debt. Assuming that all debt has one-period maturity, and that there is no seigniorage and no change in government financial assets, the government budget constraint becomes:\n\\[\nD_t^d + e_t D_t^f\n= (1+i_t^d)D_{t-1}^d + (1+i_t^f)e_t D_{t-1}^f - PB_t.\n\\]\nDefine the share of foreign-currency debt in total debt at the end of period \\(t-1\\) as:\n\\[\n\\alpha_{t-1} = \\frac{e_{t-1}D_{t-1}^f}{D_{t-1}},\n\\]\nand define the nominal depreciation rate as:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_t = \\frac{e_t - e_{t-1}}{e_{t-1}}.\n\\]\nUsing these definitions, domestic and foreign debt can be written as:\n\\[\nD_{t-1}^d = (1-\\alpha_{t-1})D_{t-1},\n\\]\n\\[\ne_t D_{t-1}^f = \\alpha_{t-1}(1+\\varepsilon_t)D_{t-1}.\n\\]\nSubstituting into the budget constraint yields the law of motion for total debt:\n\\[\nD_t\n= (1+i_t^d)(1-\\alpha_{t-1})D_{t-1}\n+ (1+i_t^f)\\alpha_{t-1}(1+\\varepsilon_t)D_{t-1}\n- PB_t.\n\\]\nDividing both sides by nominal GDP \\(P_t Y_t = (1+g_t)(1+\\pi_t)P_{t-1}Y_{t-1}\\) and defining the primary balance as a share of GDP, \\(pb_t = PB_t / (P_t Y_t)\\), yields:\n\\[\nd_t\n= \\frac{(1+i_t^d)(1-\\alpha_{t-1})}{(1+g_t)(1+\\pi_t)} d_{t-1}\n+ \\frac{(1+i_t^f)\\alpha_{t-1}(1+\\varepsilon_t)}{(1+g_t)(1+\\pi_t)} d_{t-1}\n- pb_t.\n\\]\nDefine the weighted average nominal interest rate as:\n\\[\ni_t^w = (1-\\alpha_{t-1})i_t^d + \\alpha_{t-1} i_t^f.\n\\]\nThe debt-stabilizing primary balance is:\n\\[\npb_t^* = (\\phi_t^* - 1)d_{t-1},\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\phi_t^* = \\frac{1+i_t^w + \\varepsilon_t \\alpha_{t-1} (1+i_t^f)}{(1+g_t)(1+\\pi_t)}.\n\\]"
