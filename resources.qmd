## Public Debt Dynamics

### Closed Economy

Consider an economy that does not trade with the rest of the world. Let $Y_t$ denote nominal GDP in year $t$, and $P_t$ the GDP deflator. Nominal GDP is given by the product $P_t Y_t$. Let $\pi_t$ denote the rate of inflation between $t-1$ and $t$, defined as:

$$
\pi_t = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1.
$$

Similarly, the real GDP growth rate is defined as:

$$
g_t = \frac{Y_t}{Y_{t-1}} - 1.
$$

Let $M_t$ denote the stock of money at time $t$, and for simplicity assume that all interest-bearing public debt has a one-period maturity. Let $D_{t-1}$ denote the stock of public bonds outstanding at the end of period $t-1$. The average nominal interest rate on public debt issued in $t-1$ is $i_t$. Let $AF_t$ represent government financial assets at time $t$.

Government expenditure in year $t$ consists of two components: non-interest expenditure, denoted $G_t$, and interest payments on outstanding debt, $i_t D_{t-1}$.

The government budget constraint in period $t$ is given by:

$$
G_t + i_t D_{t-1} = R_t + (D_t - D_{t-1}) + (M_t - M_{t-1}) + (AF_t - AF_{t-1}).
$$

Government budget identity implies that government expenditures are financed through net tax and non-tax revenues from the private sector, $R_t$, money creation $(M_t - M_{t-1}) \equiv \Delta M_t$, issuance of interest-bearing debt $(D_t - D_{t-1})$, and changes in financial assets $(AF_t - AF_{t-1}) \equiv \Delta AF_t$.

The fiscal balance of the government is defined as the difference between revenues and total expenditures, $R_t - (G_t + i_t D_{t-1})$. The **primary balance**, $PB_t$, is defined as revenues minus expenditures excluding interest payments:

$$
PB_t = R_t - G_t.
$$

Rearranging equation government budget and solving for $D_t$ yields:

$$
D_t = (1 + i_t)D_{t-1} - (PB_t - \Delta M_t - \Delta AF_t).
$$

Dividing both sides of equation (2) by nominal GDP $P_t Y_t$ yields:

$$
\frac{D_t}{P_t Y_t}
= \frac{(1+i_t)D_{t-1}}{P_t Y_t}
- \frac{PB_t}{P_t Y_t}
- \frac{\Delta M_t}{P_t Y_t}
- \frac{\Delta AF_t}{P_t Y_t}.
$$

Using the identities $P_t Y_t = (1+g_t)(1+\pi_t)P_{t-1}Y_{t-1}$ and defining debt, the primary balance, and seigniorage as shares of GDP:

$$
d_t \equiv \frac{D_t}{P_t Y_t}, \quad
pb_t \equiv \frac{PB_t}{P_t Y_t}, \quad
\mu_t \equiv \frac{\Delta M_t}{P_t Y_t},
$$

the previous equation can be written as:

$$
d_t = \frac{(1+i_t)}{(1+g_t)(1+\pi_t)} d_{t-1}
- (pb_t + \mu_t + af_t).
$$

Using the Fisher equation linking nominal and real interest rates:

$$
1 + r_t = \frac{1+i_t}{1+\pi_t},
$$

define:

$$
\phi_t \equiv \frac{1+r_t}{1+g_t}.
$$

With this parameter, the government budget constraint can be rewritten as:

$$
d_t = \phi_t d_{t-1} - (pb_t + \mu_t + af_t).
$$

Debt dynamics can also be analyzed by computing the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio, $\Delta d_t = d_t - d_{t-1}$. Subtracting $d_{t-1}$ from both sides yields:

$$
\Delta d_t = (\phi_t - 1)d_{t-1} - (pb_t + \mu_t + af_t).
$$

The size of the primary balance as a share of GDP, $pb_t$, is a useful indicator of the fiscal effort required to reach a desired debt level. To obtain the **debt-stabilizing primary balance**, set $\Delta d_t = 0$. For simplicity, assume that seigniorage and changes in financial assets are zero. The debt-stabilizing primary balance is therefore:

$$
pb_t = (\phi_t - 1)d_{t-1}.
$$

The debt-stabilizing primary balance depends on several factors:

1. A higher initial level of debt requires a larger primary surplus to stabilize debt.
2. A larger difference between the real interest rate and the real GDP growth rate increases the required primary balance.
3. The availability of seigniorage or other financing sources, such as privatizations, reduces the primary balance required to stabilize debt.

### Debt Dynamics in an Open Economy

The analysis of debt sustainability in an open economy is similar to that of a closed economy. However, in this case, the government can issue both domestic- and foreign-currency debt.

Total public debt at time $t$ is given by:

$$
D_t = D_t^d + e_t D_t^f,
$$

where $D_t^d$ denotes domestic-currency debt, $D_t^f$ foreign-currency debt, and $e_t$ is the nominal exchange rate (domestic currency per unit of foreign currency).

Let $i_t^d$ denote the nominal interest rate on domestic debt and $i_t^f$ the nominal interest rate on foreign debt. Assuming that all debt has one-period maturity, and that there is no seigniorage and no change in government financial assets, the government budget constraint becomes:

$$
D_t^d + e_t D_t^f
= (1+i_t^d)D_{t-1}^d + (1+i_t^f)e_t D_{t-1}^f - PB_t.
$$

Define the share of foreign-currency debt in total debt at the end of period $t-1$ as:

$$
\alpha_{t-1} = \frac{e_{t-1}D_{t-1}^f}{D_{t-1}},
$$

and define the nominal depreciation rate as:

$$
\varepsilon_t = \frac{e_t - e_{t-1}}{e_{t-1}}.
$$

Using these definitions, domestic and foreign debt can be written as:

$$
D_{t-1}^d = (1-\alpha_{t-1})D_{t-1},
$$

$$
e_t D_{t-1}^f = \alpha_{t-1}(1+\varepsilon_t)D_{t-1}.
$$

Substituting into the budget constraint yields the law of motion for total debt:

$$
D_t
= (1+i_t^d)(1-\alpha_{t-1})D_{t-1}
+ (1+i_t^f)\alpha_{t-1}(1+\varepsilon_t)D_{t-1}
- PB_t.
$$

Dividing both sides by nominal GDP $P_t Y_t = (1+g_t)(1+\pi_t)P_{t-1}Y_{t-1}$ and defining the primary balance as a share of GDP, $pb_t = PB_t / (P_t Y_t)$, yields:

$$
d_t
= \frac{(1+i_t^d)(1-\alpha_{t-1})}{(1+g_t)(1+\pi_t)} d_{t-1}
+ \frac{(1+i_t^f)\alpha_{t-1}(1+\varepsilon_t)}{(1+g_t)(1+\pi_t)} d_{t-1}
- pb_t.
$$

Define the weighted average nominal interest rate as:

$$
i_t^w = (1-\alpha_{t-1})i_t^d + \alpha_{t-1} i_t^f.
$$

The debt-stabilizing primary balance is:

$$
pb_t^* = (\phi_t^* - 1)d_{t-1},
$$

where

$$
\phi_t^* = \frac{1+i_t^w + \varepsilon_t \alpha_{t-1} (1+i_t^f)}{(1+g_t)(1+\pi_t)}.
$$
