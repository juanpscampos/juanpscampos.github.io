# Welcome to my website.
I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Nottingham, with research interests in empirical and theoretical labour economics. Before beginning my doctoral studies, I worked at several international institutions, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/)), the Inter-American Development Bank ([IDB](https://www.iadb.org/en)), and the Latin American Reserve Fund ([FLAR](https://flar.com/en/home/)).
